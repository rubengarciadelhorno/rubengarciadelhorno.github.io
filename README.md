Hi, I'm Rubén!

<body>
    Welcome to my personal website.
</body>

<img src="https://github.com/rubengarciadelhorno/rubengarciadelhorno.github.io/blob/main/foto%20(2).jpeg?raw=true" alt="Foto">

<body>
    I'm a PhD candidate in the Department of Political Science and Public Law of the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona. I'm a member of the Democracy, Elections and Citizenship research group and of the "The Rural-Urban Divide in Europe" (RUDE) project.

</body>

<body>    
    I hold a BA in Political and Administrative Sciences by Universitat Pompeu Fabra, a MA in Political Science by the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, and a postgraduate degree in Data Analysis from the University of Barcelona.

</body>

<body>
    My areas of interest include political geography (especially rural-urban and centre-periphery divides) in relation to both political attitudes and behaviours, and political representation and party systems in a broad sense.

</body>

<body>
    The RUDE project examines whether and how urban-rural residency is related to divides in legitimacy beliefs, social identities, perceptions of injustice and threat, political and social attitudes and political behaviour of European citizens, specifically in five democracies (France, Germany, Spain, Switzerland and the UK).

</body>

<body>
    My PhD thesis project focuses on the political discontent that exists in rural areas and the contextual causes that fuel it. This project aims, based on the study of the case of Spain, to detect possible more general factors.</p>
